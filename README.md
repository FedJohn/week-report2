Today’s summary on deep learning.

Deep learning is the subpart of machine learning that discovers and extracts the useful features from data using model.
On machine learning the expert extracts data then model classifies them. From there l get a concept that, deep learning can be best by working with it but more complex in design a model.
Deep learning can perform different tasks. The following are some tasks that can be performed by deep learning:-
•	Self driving car 
•	Games
•	Automatic colorization
•	Cyber attack prediction, etc
Due to the above samples of success I understood that deep learning have many applications in the world  
As machine leering, deep learning has models. Let’s see  perceptron model
Perceptron model is simplest model of neuron that accept features in form of  linear functions , combine them then change to the non-linear function. By using perceptron model we get output inform of non-linear function
There are parts of perceptron model, which are:-
•	Input 
•	Summing point   This combines input (x) and weights(w)  to form linear function
•	Activation function  This adds non-linear function properties into  linear function 
•	Output   the ouput function can be like y=sum(wx)+b
 l learned about multilayer perceptron (MLP) which is the combine of more than one perceptron model.
Multilayer perceptron have three parts which are 
•	Input layer
•	Hidden layer
•	Output layer
Between layers there are processes of feed-forward way that interconnect those layers.
Also I learned about how to training deep learning model. In order to do this, there are some steps to follow,which are 
•	Define loss functions. Here there a lot of loss functions but common are sigmoid, softmax  and ReLU
•	Compute gradient
•	Solve optimization problem
